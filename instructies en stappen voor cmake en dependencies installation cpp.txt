Install cmake: https://cmake.org/download/


Then easiest to have your own dependency manager (like e.g. pip is for python);  

## Windows
On windows: vcpkg

git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git
cd vcpkg
.\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
.\vcpkg integrate install
.\vcpkg install spdlog cxxopts opencv

vcpkg install opencv[core,highgui,tbb]

Might take a while including subdependencies, especially the first time around.

If you move the directory elsewhere, rerun .\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat

## Linux Ubuntu/Debian
Just through apt-get, e.g.:
sudo apt-get install libspdlog-dev


# VScode cmake configuration
- Install 'CMake Tools' extension
- Cmake tools will prompt to configure the project if a CMakeLists.txt is there (or search CMake: Configure in the command palette)
- Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P), type "CMake: Select a Kit", and choose the appropriate compiler (e.g., MSVC 2019 or another installed version).
- Go to settings and search for: "cmake.configureArgs", then add "-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=C:/Users/RobertWenink/Documents/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake" to the list. (take your own path here)

In fact, when also through a tasks.json + launch.json we set up the run env, add the environment variable in the cmake parameters, e.g.
